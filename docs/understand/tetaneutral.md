# The [Tetaneutral](https://docs.lora.tetaneutral.net/) project
The aim of this benevol initiativ is to develop a free LoRaWAN Network in Toulouse (FR).

## Gateways
They propose several gateways model to contribute to their network. The kit IMST Lite Gateway is the most interesting one, and contains : 
- a housing
- a pre-certified concentrator iC880A-SPI
- a Raspberry Pi
- a pre-configured SD-card

To run, it needs a battery and an antenna. 

**Budget** : 320-360€

## Sensors
### Tetraneutral temperature sensor
They created a test temperature sensor with the following components : 
- Feather M0 : it carries an AM Cortex M0 processor (the same as the Arduino Zéro's one), a LoRa module (SX127x with SPI interface) and has 256Ko of memory.
- DS18B20 temperature sensor
- Battery
- Antenna

**Budget** : 70-100€

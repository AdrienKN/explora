The quantity of collected data has never been greater, but the utilization of this data still faces certain hurdles, the most common being the private nature of the platforms on which they are transmitted and stored.</p><p>Today, organizations seeking to acquire in-situ environmental observations often have to rely on private companies due to a lack of technical knowledge and available open solutions. These companies typically offer closed and costly solutions. Users have no freedom in data exploitation and must use tools provided by the seller. These tools often offer minimal functions and typically require individual subscriptions, preventing data sharing within a community.</p><p>This problematic situation is well known in the agricultural world. For example, many farmers eager to collect meteorological data on their plots turn to private companies due to a lack of open solutions. In addition to paying for the installation of sensors, farmers must pay a hefty monthly subscription for very basic data visualization via a mobile application. They are unable to share their results or visualize those of neighboring farms. This is a significant issue considering that three-quarters of French farms belong to agricultural cooperatives, where collaboration with sometimes dozens of other farms is necessary.</p><p>Furthermore, solutions sold for capturing environmental data are often based on networks operated by private companies. Despite significant costs and the industrial nature of these solutions, it is observed that they are not always sustainable. For instance, the company SigFox, currently undergoing judicial reorganization, was taken over by Unabiz in Singapore, and Bouygues Telecom decided to discontinue its LoRaWAN offering, called Objenious. These situations highlight the challenges faced by companies operating in this sector, whether in terms of profitability, competition, or strategic commercial decisions.</p><h2 id="objective" tabindex="-1">Objective <a class="header-anchor" href="#objective" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Objective&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Build a collaborative tool to collect and share environnemental data, based on the low-tech LoRaWAN network.</p><p><strong>Steps :</strong></p><ul><li>Build a display demonstrator to visualize data recorded with LoRaWAN sensors</li><li>Propose a gateway/sensor fabrication method</li></ul>',10),r=[n];function s(l,c,d,h,u,p){return o(),t("div",null,r)}const b=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
